Batzendev.RemoteDesktopLockPrevent
==================================

Windows service which prevents a workstation/virtual machine from being locked when an RDP (remote desktop) connection is disconnected.

You should only use this service when you really know why you need it and never on a physicaly accessable machine as it renders such a machine unprotected after your RDP connection is disconnected.
